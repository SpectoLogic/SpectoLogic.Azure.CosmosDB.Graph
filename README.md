# SpectoLogic.Azure.CosmosDB.Graph
Extension Library with additional functionality for CosmosDB Graph.
Allows Serialization/Deserialization of custom objects for Graph in CosmosDB. Also allows to serialize GraphObjects to native CosmosDB JSON thus allowing you to add Vertices and Edges quickly via normal DocumentDB SQL instead of Gremlin.

**ATTENTION** 

Makes use of internal functionality of Microsoft.Azure.Graphs. This is still a prototyp (First Version). Anyone willing to contribute on this is welcome :-).

## Documentation
Documentation is under construction. See usage in Demo-Console App.
